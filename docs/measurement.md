# Measurement

Two things, both small: a weekly record of how Caliper compares with react-docgen-typescript (RDT) and react-docgen on five public repos, and `just bench` for a change that touches the resolver. Nothing here blocks a pull request.

## Weekly record

`.github/workflows/weekly.yml` runs on Mondays and by hand. `scripts/corpora.py` fetches each repo at a pinned commit and installs its dependencies with its own package manager and lockfile (lifecycle scripts off, caches under `.corpora/`, gitignored), then removes tests, stories, demos and `.d.ts` files from the source directory so every tool reads the same files. `scripts/weekly.py` runs the tools.

| Corpus | Repository | Commit | Source directory | Install |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mantine | `mantinedev/mantine` | `e47e45af06427b3b2497100c2b849935c23af30d` | `packages/@mantine/core/src` | yarn, immutable |
| chakra | `chakra-ui/chakra-ui` | `fa9696f328ea5a0df8685c6d8460edbd779b63b9` | `packages/react/src` | pnpm, frozen |
| shadcn | `shadcn-ui/ui` | `ba1503c64472b82256d9de95e2e62c5901a38e8b` | `apps/v4` | pnpm, frozen |
| antd | `ant-design/ant-design` | `ba7ccbaa7b4b58ac1ff8e6fe2e78dfa10bfb5538` | `components` | npm, no lockfile (the repo commits none) |
| spectrum | `adobe/react-spectrum` | `797762ed3526ea12f089e321bd3891066affad70` | `packages` | yarn, immutable |

It records, per corpus and tool, the wall time and peak RSS of one whole run (process start and Node start included), and the size of Caliper's canonical JSON. Caliper runs with `--load-dependencies`; its time is the median of five runs. RDT and react-docgen run once each.

Recall is measured against RDT, on the components both tools report (same file, same name):

| Measure              | Meaning                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Components           | RDT's components with props that the tool also reports                                    |
| Own props            | Of those components, RDT's props not declared by `@types/react` that the tool lists       |
| `@types/react` props | RDT's props that `@types/react` declares (`onClick`, `aria-*`, `ref`) that the tool lists |

react-docgen reads each file alone with its default resolver and importer, as Storybook does, so it lists no types declared elsewhere. That is the point of the comparison.

The run uploads `weekly.json` and a table to the job summary. It compares with the last successful run's `weekly.json` and opens, or comments on, one issue labelled `weekly-measurement` when Caliper's time or memory is more than 10% worse, or its recall is more than 2 points lower, on any corpus. There is no committed baseline: the previous run is the baseline.

### TypeScript's checker as the oracle

RDT has mistakes of its own. With `--oracle` the run also asks TypeScript 7.1's checker (`apps/validate/src/oracle.ts`, `typescript/sync` of `7.1.0-beta`) for each prop's type and compares it structurally with Caliper's canonical `--json`. The weekly table shows the share of props that agree (identical, or the same type spelled by name) and the share the checker contradicts. This is information only: the checker is a beta and the backend that uses it is an opt-in (`docs/type-checker-integration.md`).

| Verdict           | Meaning                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identical         | Both sides describe the same type                                                |
| Spelled           | The same type, Caliper by name where the checker expands it                      |
| Less precise      | Caliper's type is looser or left unevaluated                                     |
| Wrong             | Caliper's type describes something else, such as a literal union missing members |
| Checker any/error | The checker has no type                                                          |

## `just bench`

```bash
just bench                 # this checkout, uncommitted work included, against origin/main
just bench my-branch       # a branch
```

`scripts/bench.py` builds both in release mode, then times `extract --json` over Mantine and Chakra (source directory only, nothing installed, dependency loading off, no cache) with the two builds interleaved and alternating which goes first. It prints the median wall time and peak RSS of each and their ratio. The first run fetches the two source directories into `.corpora/`.

With nothing changed, the ratio stays inside 1.04 for time (95th percentile, 100 trials per corpus on CI and a laptop) and inside 1.12 for memory on CI runners. More than 1.10× in time or 1.20× in memory is worth looking at. Nothing enforces that. Run it before a resolver change goes up for review, and say in the pull request when a cost is intended.

## What this replaces

Before the weekly record, four workflows (Equivalence, Parity, Scorecard and Allow-list empty) ran against every pull request or `main` push, backed by `scripts/equivalence.py`, a per-pull-request allow-list directory and two committed baselines. They caught one regression in speed and one in output that review would have missed. They also failed on runner noise, on bases that had moved and on their own allow-list, and a lot of one week of merge work went to keeping them green. Git history has them.

What we give up: a pull request that slows the resolver or changes output no longer fails by itself. Review, `just bench` and the weekly issue catch it, the last one days later.

## Results, 2026-10-23

Measured with the parity script this replaces: `main` at `7bc120f4`, Apple Silicon laptop, 7 runs, with `--load-dependencies`.

RDT's memory is its process's peak RSS and its time excludes Node's start; Caliper's time includes process start.
